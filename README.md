# MyBlog
A personal website project built for blogging and learning purposes. This site will serve as a place to share my thoughts, experiences, and projects, while also helping me practice web development skills.

## Getting Started
Open website in a browser to view the site. On load, an introductory sequence introduces the blog and asks for your name. You can skip the intro at any time using the **Skip** button.
